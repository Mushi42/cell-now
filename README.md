# Cell Now

We want to review your technical implementation as well as your design implementation therefore both are required to complete the task.

## The assignment

You will be designing and building a small website for a company called CellNow which sells cellular phones and accessories. They have a wide range of products that you can buy directly from their website.

The assignment is divided into two parts that will be evaluated.

## Mockups:

![Home screen](./img/home.png "Home screen")

![Shopping cart](./img/shopping-cart.png "Shopping cart")

---

### Part one:

The styling of the website and how the styling is implemented with best practices (preferably using EmotionJS).

Attached are two very rough mockups of the UX, you have total freedom of how you implement structure and design of these screens. They are only examples.

You can use any design system you want or do everything from scratch.

### Part two:

The functionality of the shopping cart.

User stories:
• As a user I would like to add a product to the shopping cart and see the number of items in the cart.
• As a user I want to be able to change the quantity of a product in my shopping cart.
• As a user I want to be able to remove an item from the shopping cart.

### Technology requirements

- React (with or without NextJS)
- All components should be functional components (No Class based components)
- TypeScript
- EmotionJS for styling is preferred but still optional
- No need to create a database
- Not required to create a backend, in React state is good enough.
- Unit testing is optional
- Integrations tests are optional (we use Cypress)
- No Sketch file or design file needed.

If you are missing any information on the task, make a decision yourself and document it, explain what was missing and/or why you did it that way.
